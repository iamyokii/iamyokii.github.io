    <h1>The Tranformation</h1>

    <br>
    Transformational leadership changes and transforms people. Not everyone can be a transformational leader.  On a conscious level, most people aren’t open to change.  They believe strongly in their convictions and values or are even afraid to change. Transformational leaders are people who inspire change and these types of leaders motivate even those who seem to be unchangeable (PSU, L10).

    People often consider their values and ethics important as an integral part of who they are. Transformational leadership has to do with these values and ethics as well as emotions and standards. This means transformational leadership is looking to change some powerful ideals; this in turn means that these leaders must have some sort of power over people.  These leaders are passionate and driven and these are powerful traits to have.  Transformational leaders motivate and influence others (PSU, L10).

                When I think of transformational leaders I think of Gandhi. Gandhi was an incredible man and role model to many people. He wanted to bring attention to India and it’s problems and he did so through his non-violent methods. At the time Gandhi was alive, India was in a crisis. Great Britain had rule over India and treated the Indian people like slaves. Crisis is a situational characteristic of transformational leadership (PSU, L10). If there is no crisis, there isn’t any need for change or transformation. India needed a change and Gandhi was the one who was going to be the leader of that change. In our commentary, it says that transformational leaders help their followers achieve more than what is expected of them (PSU, L10). He brought an entire country (India) out from under the rule of another (Great Britain). Certainly, the citizens of India at the time did not expect to ever be able to have freedom from the British. Gandhi was the man who helped them achieve this freedom. He could talk to a crowd of people and each member felt as if he was speaking directly to them. This is an example of a characteristic of transformational leadership called personalized leadership. He amazed his followers but he never acted like he was better than them. He bonded with them and was kind even to his enemies. He believed himself to be a rebel for a just cause and used nonviolence for change even though he knew it was a difficult method. He encouraged others to use nonviolence as change though Indian citizens had been treated harshly for so long they felt they deserved to fight the British with violence. He was willing to be a martyr for his belief of the ultimate truth, that all should be equal and he must be the son to all society to achieve this equality(lxlos, 2011). This willingness to be a martyr is a type of self-sacrafice used by transformational leaders to build trust with their followers (PSU, L10).

               Gandhi had a vision of using nonviolence to free India from Britain’s power over them. Having a vision for the future is another characteristic of transformational leadership (PSU, L10).  His people wanted to fight against the British but Gandhi wanted Indians to see they could achieve peace without fighting.

    An example of how Gandhi encouraged others to follow his vision of peaceful resistance has to do with a time that the British wanted all Indians to be fingerprinted and registered. Women were stripped naked in front of British soldiers so they could identify body marks. Gandhi decided the best way to fight this law was to stay in prison until the law was changed. He encouraged his people to accept the suffering that the British imparted on them without resistance. He knew that when the heart is closed, there is no getting through to the head (lxlos, 2011).  He promoted civil resistance and nonviolence when Hindu and Muslim marriages were declared invalid. Many indentured workers walked away from their jobs. This created a lot of problems for the whites that they worked for that the law was rescinded.

                Transformational leaders speak to people’s emotions and values. Gandhi encouraged open revolt but wanted no bloodshed. With the British levy on salt, Gandhi began his journey to the sea with only 80 followers. As interest built over the 24 days it took him to get there, hundreds of thousands Indians were with him when he reached the sea.  This encouraged others to make and sell salt and to show courage as their oppressors clubbed them and threw them in prison. The Indian people felt empowered through the words and actions of Gandhi. This empowerment of followers is a characteristic of transformational leadership. There was so much attention brought to the plight of these people that eventually the British released Gandhi to negotiate the levy.

                Even after Gandhi died, people remember the type of leader he was and people all over the world follow his example. He is an amazing example of transformational leadership. He took a group of people, the Indian citizens, and changed their minds on what they had to do to create change. They went from wanting to violently kill the British, to being able to use nonviolence to successfully rid the British from their country. Gandhi is the definition of a transformational leader. He changed and transformed a country by appealing to their emotions and values. He motivated them to accomplish more than they thought they could by bonding with his people. He was passionate and driven and had a vision of freedom for the future of India that was achieved.
